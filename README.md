# Expense Tracker

**Expense Tracker** is a reference solution to geeksforgeek's [expense-tracker](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs/expense-tracker-using-react/). 
It was made so that I could practice using React. In retrospect, I feel that I could improve on these next time: **a.** reducing prop drilling hell 
**b.** learning and practicing best practices for css organization.

clone and cd into the repository, then run:
